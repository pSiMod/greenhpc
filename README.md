Simulation Analysis tool
=======================

Introduction
------------
This tool automates the process of running simulation and analysis workflows on large clusters or super computers. This tool helps the user to define the machine architecture and set the values for applicaiton and run time parameters for the simulation. 

Using this tool you can run several iteration of simulation by giving a range of values to several parameters. The results of the simulation are shown using graphs in the browser.
